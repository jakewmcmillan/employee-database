# Employee Database

## Description

This is an application that is designed for a manager to organize and update their employee roster.  This application has many real world uses to manage a team or group of individiuals.  It showcases the power of using mysql.  This is the first project in which I wrote my own schema.sql and seeds.sql file.  This application is ran through the command line.
